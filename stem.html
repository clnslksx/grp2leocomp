<p>STEM subjects, or science, technology, engineering, and math, play an important part in today's increasingly competitive and globalized society. 
Without STEM, fewer breakthroughs in terms of saving lives, boosting the economy, and increasing production would be made. The demand for STEM-based 
education is growing as scientific and technical advancements become the focal point of knowledge-based economies. Colleges and universities all over
 the world are quickly reacting by offering an increasing number of STEM programs. Every year, more educational institutions offer more STEM-related programs, 
encouraging students to major in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. This means that career-minded students will have a wide selection 
of work options to pick from. Many students will discover that not all STEM courses are made equal after reviewing the list. While all of them are
 difficult, certain courses provide more prospects for employment than others. In this article, readers will learn more about STEM courses, including 
what they offer and what students may expect while enrolling in STEM-related disciplines.<br>

<br>List of STEM courses<br>
<br>1.Petroleum Engineering<br>
Petroleum engineering refers to the field of engineering that deals with the production of hydrocarbons, which can either be natural gas or crude oil. 
Students in this program will learn about engineering basics, geology, and thermodynamics. Most courses will also be focusing on how to address and solve 
crucial issues on energy security, providing students with the knowledge and skills that they need to determine the most efficient ways in the exploration, 
extraction, and production of oil.<br>
<br>2. Computer Engineering <br>
Computer engineering is a common education for people who want to work as computer hardware engineers, which is one of the high-paying STEM careers available today. Hardware engineers create a wide variety of computer equipment, testing and analyzing the hardware they have built. They may also be tasked with updating existing computer hardware or managing the manufacturing of new devices.<br>
<br> 3.Biological Sciences <br>
With a bachelor’s degree in the biological sciences, students can pursue multiple career avenues in research, teaching, and fieldwork or use it as a good base to move into the medical, biotech, and pharmaceutical industries. Many biology degree graduates choose to take a postgraduate level to broaden their expertise and accelerate career progression.<br>
<br>4.BS Marine Biology <br>
The Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology is a four-year curriculum that teaches students about marine life and its ecology. The course covers modern biological science principles and theories, as well as the physical and biological foundations of aquatic life.<br>
<br>5. BS Psychology<br>
The  majority of psychology bachelor's degree holders go on to work in human or social services. Career counselor, psychiatric technician, rehabilitation expert, and case manager are all common jobs in this industry.<br>
<br>6.BS Civil Engineering <br>
The Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (BSCE) is a four-year program designed to provide students with mathematical and scientific knowledge that can be applied to a variety of specializations including structural, transportation, water resource, geotechnical, environmental, and construction project management.<br>
<br>7. BS Applied Mathematics<br>
The Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics is a four-year curriculum that gives students a solid foundation in various mathematical approaches and how they can be applied to data analysis, optimization, and modeling. Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, and Analysis are the topics of study in this subject.
<br>8.The Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics (BS Applied Physics) is a four-year degree that teaches how to apply physics principles to current programs in a range of professions, including but not limited to medical, engineering, computer science, and others. <br>
<br>9.BS Computer Science<br>
A bachelor's degree in computer science (BSCS) is a four-year program that covers computing concepts and theories, algorithmic foundations, and new computing developments.<br>
<br>10.BS Chemistry<br>
A four-year bachelor's degree in computer science (BSCS) covers computing principles and theories, algorithmic foundations, and contemporary computing developments.
